To solve the compatibility for the rxjs when you're using
then use the next line

  $ sudo npm install rxjs@6 rxjs-compat@6 ..save

Or if you want to migrate to Angular6 and you have the pro
blem that you cant find 'rxjs/Observable' in the services
you just have to install rxjs-compat this way

  $ sudo npm install --save rxjs-compat

Or if you want to just use Angular6 without any install you
have to import the observable this way in your services

  import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

For using the .map you have to transform it from

  .map(res=>res.json());

to

  .pipe(map(res=>res.json()));
